        Initiates a connection to the server and marks the client as running. This function

        This method is responsible for establishing a socket connection to the specified
        server using the host and port attributes set during the client's initialization.
        It creates a TCP socket object, attempts to connect to the server, and sets the
        self.is_running attribute to True upon a successful connection. It logs
        the connection attempt and reports any errors encountered during the process.

        Returns:
            True or false depending on whether the connection was successful.

        Exceptions:
            - OSError: Raised if the socket encounters a problem (e.g., network
              issue, invalid host/port).

        Packed Data Format:
            [filename_length(ushort)] - the length of the filename

    def compute_hash(self, data):

        Computes a hash for given data using the SHAKE-128 algorithm.

        In this assignment, we'll use the hashlib library to compute a hash of the data
        being shared between the client and the server. A hash is a fixed-length string
        generated based on arbitrary input data. The same data will result in the same
        hash, and any change to the data will result in a different hash.  We're using this
        very simplistically to introduce the idea of hashing and integrity checking, which
        we'll be exploring in more detail later in the semester.

        1. Import hashlib and call hashlib.shake_128() to create a new SHAKE-128 hash object.
        2. Use the update() method to add the data to the hash object.
        3. Use the digest() method to retrieve the hash value and return it.

        The shake_128 algorithm is convenient for us since we can specify the length of the
        hash it produces. This allows us to generate a short hash for use in our tests.

        Parameters:
            data (bytes): The data to be hashed.
            hash_length (int): The desired length of the hash output.

        Returns:
            bytes: The computed hash.

        Shuts down the client by stopping its operation and closing the socket.

        This method is responsible for cleanly terminating the client's operation.
        It indicates that the client is no longer in operation. If the client has an
        active socket connection, it closes the socket to ensure proper release of
        resources and network cleanup.

        The method logs the shutdown process, providing visibility into the client's
        state transitions. It's designed to be safely callable even if the socket is
        already closed or not initialized, preventing any unexpected exceptions during
        the shutdown process.

            - Do NOT set client_socket to None in this method. The autograder will examine
